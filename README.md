# DiskWorld

We wanted to play the iOS game 'Centrifeud' once again eventhough we were not
crowded around the same iPad anymore, but in different parts of the world

online multiplayer support. Here it goes!


## Running

It's a stack project setup. So,

  stack build
  stack exec diskworld
  
## Centrifeud iPad Game

Check it out! It's the best local multiplayer game there is:
