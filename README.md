# DiskWorld

We wanted to play the iOS game 'Centrifuge' once again eventhough we were not
crowded around the same iPad anymore, but in different parts of the world
now. So I decided to try some Haskell game dev to re-create the game with
online multiplayer support. Here it goes!


## Running

It's a stack project setup. So,

  stack build
  stack exec diskworld
